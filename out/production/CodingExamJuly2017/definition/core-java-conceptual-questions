Please answer the below core-java Questions:

Q.What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A: Java Development Toolkit contains various components such as Run Time Interpreter, The Compiler, The Debugger, The Applet Viewer,
The Header, API Source Code, The class file disassembler and The Documentation Generator.

Q.What is IDE?
A: Integrated Development Environment is a software application which enables users to more easily write and debug Java programs.

Q.What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
A: Eclipse, IntelliJ, NetBeans, JCreator, BlueJ, Kawa, DrJava and JBuilder.

Q.Explain the entire java life cycle.
A: Once Java code is written in text editor or in java IDE and saved as dot(.)java extension which is then compiled by using java compiler
and create a .class file. Class file contains bytecodes. The class file then load into the JVM using java loader. Finally JVM reads the bytecodes
in memory and translate them into machine code for us to see the output.

Q.What is class?
A: Class is a blue print of an Object

Q.What is object?
A: An Object is an instance of a class.

Q.What is the entry point of an application?
A: main method.

Q.Why main is static?
A: Since main() is static it can be directly invoked via the class.

Q.What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
A: Java interface are implicitly abstract and cannot have implementations. A Java abstract class can have instance methods that
implements a default behavior. Variables declared in a Java interface is by default final. An  abstract class may contain non-final
variables. Members of a Java interface are public by default. A Java abstract class can have private, protected method. Java interface
should be implemented using keyword “implements”. A Java abstract class should be extended using keyword “extends”. An abstract class can
extend another Java class and implement multiple Java interfaces. A Java class can implement multiple interfaces but it can extend only one
abstract class.

Q.Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
A: Interface is absolutely abstract and cannot be instantiated. A Java abstract class also cannot be instantiated, but can be invoked.
Any variable declare in the interface are final or constant. One can create an instance of an anonymous subclass of your abstract class.
And then it could be invoked the method from abstract class reference pointing to subclass object.

Q.What is Access Specifier?
Access Specifier is used to access classes, constructors, methods and fields that is regulated using access modifiers.
Access modifiers are: Private, public, protected and default type.

Q.What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
A: OOP stands for Object Orieted Programming.

Abstraction: Abstraction is implementation hiding
Encapsulation: Encapsulation is data hiding
Inheritance: Inheritance is way to acquire properties from one class to another class.
Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of an Object to take on many forms

Q.What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
A: API : Appication Programming Interface is a list of all classes that are part of the JDK.
java.util
java.applet
java.io
java.lang
java.math

Q.Does java support multiple inheritance?
A: Yes, only through Interface.

Q.What is method overloading and when it happens?
In a class, there can be several methods with the same name. However they must have a different signatures.
Methods with the same name in a class are called overloaded methods.
Overloadding happens during compile time.

Q.Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
A: When an error occurs within a method, the method creates an object and hands it off to the runtime system. The object,
called an exception object, contains information about the error, including its type and the state of the program when the
error occurred. Creating an exception object and handing it to the runtime system is called throwing an exception
We can handle exception by using try and catch method.

Q.What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
The static keyword in java is used for memory management mainly. We can apply java static keyword with variables, methods,
blocks and nested class. The static keyword belongs to the class than instance of the class.
In class variable or method with static key word, variable can be access by all the methods and the method could
be access without class initiation

Q.What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
A: Final is a keyword with variables to specify its values are not to be changed. However we can change the
value in the constructor / methods of the class.
- Final Variable is declared inside method modified by final keyword is called final variable. Final variables are often
declared with static keyword in java and treated as constant
- A Java method with the final keyword is called a final method and it can not be overridden in the subclass

Q.What is final, finally and finalize?
-Final is used to apply restrictions on class, method and variable. Final class can't be inherited, final method can't be
overridden and final variable value can't be changed. it's a method
-Finally is used to place important code, it will be executed whether exception is handled or not. It's a block
-Finalize is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected. Finalize is a method.

Q.What is a constructor ?
A: Constructor is used to intialise object. A class can have multiple constructor. If a class doesn't have constructor, it will take
default constructor.

Q.What is "this" keyword in java ?
A: Keyword "this" is a reference variable in Java that refers to the current object. It can be used to refer instance variable of current
class. It can be used to invoke or initiate current class constructor

Q.What is "super" keyword in java?
Super is used in subclass’s constructor to initialize it’s super class constructor.

Q.What is JVM stand for ?
A: Java Virtual Machine.

Q.What version of java are you using?
A: 1.8.1

Q.What is JAR stand for ?
Java Archive

Q.What is compile time and run time?
A: Compilation process of source code to machine code is referred to as compile time.
Also a compiled program can be opened and run by a user. When an application is running, it is called runtime.

Q.What is heap?
A: Heap is a dynamic memory allocation stored in the RAM. Java heap is the heap size allocated to JVM applications
which takes care of the new objects being created.

Q.How java manage it's memory?
A: Java objects reside in an area called the heap. When the heap becomes full, garbage is collected. During the garbage
collection objects that are no longer used are cleared, thus making space for new objects.

Q.What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
A: String object is can not be changed once the value stored in the string whereas StringBuffer and StringBuilder object
can be changed. StringBuffer and StringBuilder have the same methods with one difference and that's of synchronization. StringBuffer
is synchronized that means it is thread safe and hence we can use it when you implement threads for our methods, whereas
StringBuilder is not synchronized.

Q.What is Singleton class?
A: A singleton class is a class that can have only one object at a time. To design a singleton class we need to make constructor as private.

Q.What is Serialization and Deserialization?
A: Serialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent
through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization.

Q.Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
A: Both represents same number of values.

Q.Why is String Immutable in Java?
A: Mutable strings could cause security problem in Reflection too, as the parameters are strings.

Q.What is constructor chaining in Java?
A: Constructor chaining in java is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to current object.

Q.The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
A: A serial collector is a default copying collector which uses only one GC thread for the GC operation, while a parallel collector
uses multiple GC threads for the GC operation.

Q.What is JIT stands for?
A: Just-In-Time compiler.

Q.Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
A: Java objects reside in an area called the heap. The heap is created when the JVM starts up and may increase or decrease in size
while the application runs. When the heap becomes full, garbage is collected. During the garbage collection objects that are no longer
used are cleared, thus making space for new objects. Note that the JVM uses more memory than just the heap.

Q.Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
A: No

Though this request mechanism provides an opportunity for the programmer to initiate the process but it depends on the JVM.
It can choose to reject the request and so it is not guaranteed that these calls will do the garbage collection. This decision
is taken by the JVM based on the space availability in heap memory.

Q.What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
A: -Stack is used for static memory allocation and Heap for dynamic memory allocation.
   -Both stored in the computer's RAM.
   -Variables allocated on the stack are stored directly to the memory and access to this memory is very fast,
   -The stack is always reserved in a Last In First Out (LIFO) order, the most recently reserved block is always the next block to be freed.
   -This makes it really simple to keep track of the stack, freeing a block from the stack is nothing more than adjusting one pointer.
   -Variables allocated on the heap have their memory allocated at run time and accessing this memory is a bit slower,
   -The heap size is only limited by the size of virtual memory.
